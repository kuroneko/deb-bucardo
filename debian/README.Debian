Bucardo for Debian
------------------

To use Bucardo, execute psql --file /usr/share/bucardo/bucardo.schema as a
PostgreSQL superuser, which creates a user named "bucardo" and a database also
named "bucardo", then populate the tables in that database as required, then
configure /etc/bucardorc to access that database, and enable the bucardo
daemon in /etc/default/bucardo.
